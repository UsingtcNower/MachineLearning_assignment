#Introduction
In this report, I will use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. And the goal of this report is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise.

#Process
Load the data
```{r}
download.file("https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv", destfile="pml-training.csv", method="curl")
download.file("https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv", destfile="pml-testing.csv", method="curl")
training <- read.csv("pml-training.csv")
testing <- read.csv("pml-testing.csv")
head(training)
colnames(training)
head(testing)
colnames(testing)
```
Clean the dataset
```{r}
